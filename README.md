# study-tracker
An X-Hour Monthly Study Tracker.
Use Gemini AI to headstart the coding for my monthly tracker. After running into some errors and miscommunication, I used the Developer Tool on the Google browser to revised the code how I wanted the front end to look. After that I went into VS Code to update and preview the code throughtout the revision. 
I haven't coded in 5 years and it was very introductory HTML, so I'm sure there are some lines in the coded that aren't needed. However. I'm completely fine with that until I'm at place in my journey and life to come back in and remove any unnecessary lines.
Until then, enjoy :) 

p.s. all updates to the coding can be found under Updated index.html on here
